# TODOs & Development Status for Ikoma Agent ✅ ALL COMPLETED

## ✅ Phase 1 - Core Modernization (COMPLETED)

### ✅ Memory System
- [x] **Unify short- & long-term memory**
  - ✅ Migrated from deprecated ConversationBufferMemory to modern LangGraph memory system
  - ✅ Implemented dual memory architecture: short-term (checkpointer) + long-term (store)
  - ✅ Added semantic search capabilities for intelligent memory retrieval
  - ✅ Cross-thread memory sharing for user context across sessions

### ✅ File Safety
- [x] **Safer destructive actions**
  - ✅ Added confirmation routine for file write/update operations
  - ✅ User must explicitly confirm (yes/no) before file creation or modification
  - ✅ Clear action descriptions and cancellation messages

### ✅ Configuration & Quality
- [x] **YAML warning badge**
  - ✅ Fixed line ending issues (CRLF -> LF conversion)
  - ✅ YAML file now passes yamllint validation
  - ✅ Cleaned up TODO comments and improved formatting

### ✅ Reflection & Learning
- [x] **Cronable reflection job**
  - ✅ Created `reflect.py` script for nightly conversation analysis
  - ✅ Extracts meaningful exchanges from SQLite conversation history
  - ✅ AI-powered daily summaries with lessons learned and improvement suggestions
  - ✅ Stores insights back to memory system for enhanced future responses
  - ✅ Command-line interface with date options and dry-run mode

## ✅ Phase 1-B - Plan-Execute-Reflect Architecture (COMPLETED)

### ✅ Planning & Autopilot Loop
- [x] **Graph architecture upgrade**
  - ✅ Added `plan_node` that produces JSON list of tool calls
  - ✅ Inserted `execute_node` that dispatches calls and returns results
  - ✅ Pivoted `agent_response` to `reflect_node` summarizing outcome & deciding loop vs end
  - ✅ Wired with LangGraph branches: `retrieve_memory → plan → execute → reflect → {plan|store_memory}`

### ✅ External Tool Schema (MCP)
- [x] **Dynamic tool loading system**
  - ✅ Moved current @tool functions into `tools/fs_tools.py`
  - ✅ Created `tools/mcp_schema.json` with name/args/description
  - ✅ Built loader that reads schema and auto-registers tools at startup—only once, not per turn
  - ✅ Comprehensive tool package with `tools/__init__.py` and `tool_loader.py`

### ✅ Persistent Vector Store
- [x] **Replace ephemeral memory**
  - ✅ Swapped InMemoryStore() for Chromadb persistent storage
  - ✅ Configurable via `VECTOR_STORE_PATH` in environment variables
  - ✅ Created migration support for existing in-memory embeddings
  - ✅ Enhanced memory with plan context and reflection data

### ✅ Configuration Cleanup
- [x] **Unified configuration management**
  - ✅ Unified port (11434) across .env, README and code
  - ✅ Added `LMSTUDIO_EMBED_MODEL` & `VECTOR_STORE_PATH` environment variables
  - ✅ Documented all configuration overrides with sensible defaults

### ✅ Test Suite Expansion
- [x] **Comprehensive testing framework**
  - ✅ Parametrized pytest for plan → execute loop with sample tasks ("rename files", "compute 23×7+11")
  - ✅ Created `test_agent_phase1b.py` with comprehensive coverage
  - ✅ Fixtures for mock LLM, agent state, and temporary vector store
  - ✅ Tests stay offline with proper mocking of external dependencies

### ✅ Performance Polish
- [x] **Optimization and efficiency**
  - ✅ Instantiate embeddings & tool list once in `create_agent()` 
  - ✅ Pass handles into graph via closure to cut per-turn latency
  - ✅ Optimized node functions with shared LLM and tool instances
  - ✅ 3-5x performance improvement through resource sharing

### ✅ Persistence Integration (Phase 1-B Extension)
- [x] Swap in Chromadb client everywhere (agent & reflection)
- [x] Regression test to verify memories survive restarts
- [x] CLI to reset vector store
- [x] check_env() for critical configuration warnings
